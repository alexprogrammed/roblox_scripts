# roblox_scripts
This is where I post Roblox scripts that I've made.<br>
# about
I made this because I don't want to have to put the entire script inside the editor, it's better to use HttpGet with raw content. Plus using HttpGet will auto-update the module based off of what is in GitHub.<br><br>
The scripts should work with SynapseX but I don't guarantee that they'll work with a different executor.
# init
Inside this folder is what you are probably looking for, these will auto update and have a config.
# scripts
Inside this folder is the source code of scripts, recommended to use init.
